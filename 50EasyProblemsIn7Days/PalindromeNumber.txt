[9. Palindrome Number]

Question:

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?[IMP]

My Solution:
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int temp = 0, temp2 = x;
        while(temp2 > 0) {
            temp = (temp * 10) + (temp2 % 10);
            temp2 = temp2 / 10;
        }
        return (temp == x);
    }
}

Leetcode Solution:

public class Solution {
    public bool IsPalindrome(int x) {
        // Special cases:
        // As discussed above, when x < 0, x is not a palindrome.
        // Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
        // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0.
        // Only 0 satisfy this property.
        if(x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
            return false;
        }

        int revertedNumber = 0;
        while(x > revertedNumber) {
            revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        // When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
        // For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
        // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
        return x == revertedNumber || x == revertedNumber/10;
    }
}


Approach:
1. Reverse the number and check with original[It may overflow :(]
2. Only reverse uptill half the digits.
